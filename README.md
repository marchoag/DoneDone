# DoneDone
My first attempt at a simple HTML/CSS/JS to-do list. Making extensive use of ChatGPT to learn.

UPDATE: Also trying to make my first ever user/pw creation/login/management.

It's essentially a copy/paste from W3C Schools that I'm playing around with to learn; eventually I hope to build it from scratch and incorporate user management and database (probably via Firebase?).
